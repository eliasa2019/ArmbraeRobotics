VexNET Robotics
====
This repository contains all necessary files to program the VexNET robot framework, including
1. a basic template for a robot controlled by two sticks and with a claw on an arm, and
2. a completed program with programmed motors and a gear shift feature.
The RobotC IDE is dowloadable from the [Vex EDR website](https://www.vexrobotics.com/robotc-vexedr-vexiq.html) and the C standard
library is dowloadable from [GNU's website](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) in case you need it. The RobotC programming
language is heavily based on C, though most features you may need to program for the robot can be easily implemented with a basic
background in any programming language.
